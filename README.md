## Description

This project is still very much in it's infnacy, but the goal is to create a toolbox for web-developers to use styled components that follow best accessibility practices

This project was also a way for me to learn how to use different technogoies, Most of this stack is new to me _(I used Twind instead of TailwindCSS directly)_ and I have to say I love using JSX on the server side. And Typescript is a godsend.

## Setup

clone the repository and run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
touch .env && echo "PORT=<port>\nHOST=<host>" > .env
```

## Goals

- [ ] Deploy MVP
- [ ] Create a component (or component tree) for the Loading Screen
